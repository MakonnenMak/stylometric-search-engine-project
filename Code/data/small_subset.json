Inflation isn't an immediate result of the money supply increase, nor is it ALWAYS going to happen unless the economy CAN'T HANDLE THE SUDDEN INCREASE.

Rocket science is simple relative to this.\r\n\r\nAgain, because details aren't simple to predict doesn't mean general direction can't be estimated.\r\n\r\n\"Mostly because you are fucktard.\"\r\n\r\nLOL  you can't even get the insult right.

If I write 67,000 lines of source code to print out \"Hello World\", that's also too much. \r\n\r\nBut *how* is it too much? The primary *way* that \"too big\" code is \"too big\" is not because it's verbose. It's because it performs too many operations. \r\n\r\nSo as I said, if you're counting characters or lines of source code, you're missing the point. Count operations. \r\n\r\nOf course, in order to count (or at least estimate) operations, one needs to understand both the compilation process, and the resulting machine or assembly language. And this, in turn, suggests an improvement exercise far more useful than golf:\r\n\r\nWrite compilers.\r\n\r\nWith a couple of compilers under one's belt, one begins to be able to pierce the abstraction layer of source code and think about what one's executable is doing on the metal. Certainly a profiler helps with this (and if you don't profile, then you're worrying about optimization too early), but a good coder should be able to predict with a good degree of accuracy what the profiler is going to tell him. \r\n\r\nIn sum, optimizations that shrink the source code may be true or false optimizations. Optimizations that shrink the machine code are true optimizations (for space), and optimizations that shrink the operation count are true optimizations (for speed). \r\n\r\nGolf may be valid on a level of 100k vs. 50k, but when one starts counting bytes, it's just a cleverness contest.

They've been engaging in terrorism for decades like the previous WTC bombing and the Al Khobar attack. *Most* terrorists don't get shit for their actions except a sense of perverse satisfaction - how has the life of the average Palestinian improved after the hundreds of bombs exploded in Israel by Hamas/PLO. Besides Osama probably believed the hype that he and his Taliban buddies were impregnable in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to give you a conspiracy theory of my own. There was one guy who benefited immensely from the aftermath of 9/11. From being an economic pariah, he became a major 'ally' in the war on terror, getting billions of dollars in economic and military aid. His selling nuclear technologies to countries like N Korea and Libya was overlooked by the US. Not to mention a lucrative book deal, and an appearance on the Daily Show. A member of a secret intelligence service that created and funded the Taliban in the first place, funnily enough, it was his country that would have benefited the most if the Unocal deal had gone through.

It's like saying that finding a quarter on the ground is like finding a suitcase stuffed to the brim with hundred dollar bills.  Sure, technically a comparison could be made, but only an intellectually dishonest person would make it.  In insisting on comparing Saddam to Hitler you are trivializing what Hitler did.  In trivializing what Hitler did, you are offering a defense of Hitler.  We already went over that and you just restated your erroneous view without addressing anything I said.  In offering a defense of Hitler you are really doing what you claimed Olbermann did, a claim you did not even try to defend.  How does it feel to be such an utter and complete hypocrite?\r\n\r\nYou are a moral degenerate incapable of admitting error no matter how egregious your errors are.  At this point, I'm not really offended since I can't really care too much about what you say, given that you are either so brazenly unreflective or so incredibly intellectually dishonest that your opinion has no value whatever.  While you should apologize, the apology you really owe is to yourself to yourself for debasing yourself this badly in intellectually immoral sophistry.  I do feel sorry for you, you've sunk yourself into a serious low, you have humiliated yourself.  All I can do is try to help, by recommending you face the truth.  The first step to facing the truth is learning to admit that you are wrong.  While it's hard to say, it appears that your egotism is likely to be at the root of why you can't admit your errors.
